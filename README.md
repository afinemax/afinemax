# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

Hi, I'm Max! I'm an graduate student studying Physics & Astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam. I'm passionate about exploring the unknown, improving our understanding of the cosmos, and adding to the collective knowledge of humankind. I believe that science has the power to change the world and I'm eager to contribute to that change in any way I can.<br> 

I am Highly proficient in Linux, git, data analysis, and fluent in Python programming, specializing in packages such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pytorch, pandas, RM-TOOLS, and astropy. I am skilled in data analysis, time-series analysis, algorithm development, and scientific computing. I have contributed significantly to the open-source scientific Python package RM-TOOLS, resulting in a published scientific paper.

While I currently live in the Netherlands, I hold dual citizenship in the USA and Canada, which enables me to work & live in both countries.  As a UofT graduate, I additionally qualify for the High Potential Individual visa (UK work visa).
