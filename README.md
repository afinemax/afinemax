I'm Max Fine, a PhD student at McGill University and a member of the [AstroFlash](https://astroflash-frb.github.io/) group. I work with the **Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment** [(CHIME/FRB)](https://www.chime-frb.ca/) and the **Canadian Hydrogen Observatory and Radio-transient Detector** [(CHORD)](https://www.chord-observatory.ca/home) collaborations under Professors Vicky Kaspi and Jason Hessels. These are cutting-edge radio telescopes located in Canada.

I recently completed my MSc in Physics & Astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam, where I was also a member of the AstroFlash group and the CHIME/FRB collaboration, working with Professors Jason Hessels and Ziggy Pleunis. Before that, I earned my undergraduate degree in Physics & Astronomy (with Honors) at the University of Toronto.

My research centers on Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) - both detecting them and using them as tools to probe the universe. I’m broadly interested in radio transients, pulsars, scintillation, cosmic magnetism, observational cosmology, and polarization, as well as the instrumentation and software that make cutting-edge radio astronomy possible. I'm also deeply engaged with data science for radio and multimessenger astronomy, with experience in algorithm design, scalable software pipelines, and machine learning.

Outside of research, I enjoy reading, exploring new cafés in search of the perfect latte, tinkering with Raspberry Pis, and throwing a frisbee. Come join my [Minecraft server](https://afinemax.github.io/mc_server_website/), which I host on my Raspberry Pi.

### Research:  
- **Maintainer of the CHIME/FRB exposure pipeline** - Tracks On-source time, telescope downtime, and calibrates sensitivity using a catalog of pulsars. [Private CHIME repo](https://github.com/CHIMEFRB/frb-exposure)
-  **Scintillation of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)** - My MSc thesis at the University of Amsterdam explores how FRBs twinkle, [Private CHIME repo](https://github.com/CHIMEFRB/chime_repeaters_scintillation).
-  **FRBs with the 25m Dwingeloo Radio Telescope** - Built a real-time FRB detection pipeline for the 25M radio telescope, and detected a real burst during summer 2024 internship at ASTRON. [Project Repo](https://github.com/afinemax/Astron_2024)
-  **Multiwavelength search for FRBs** - Searched for gamma-ray counterparts to FRBs using CHIME and the Swift/BAT satellite. [Project Repo](https://github.com/afinemax/swift-bat) 
-  **Correcting extreme Faraday rotation** - Method for correcting intrachannel bandwidth depolarization, implemented into [RM-Tools(Repo)](https://github.com/CIRADA-Tools/RM-Tools). [MNRAS Fine et al 2023 (paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03134)
