# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

My name is Max Fine. I'm a graduate student studying Physics & Astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam. I earned my undergraduate degree from the University of Toronto (with Honors)  in Canada! I am originally from St. Augustine, Florida. I'm passionate about exploring the unknown, improving our understanding of the cosmos, and adding to the collective knowledge of humankind. I believe that science has the power to change the world and I'm eager to contribute to that change in any way I can.<br> 

I have a keen interest in radio astronomy and multimessenger astronomy. I am interested in scientific
data processing with a potential inclination toward instrumentation. My background includes experience in algorithm development for radio astronomy, error testing a data
analysis pipeline, and dedicated research in Fast Radio Burst (FRB) and multimessenger astronomy.
Furthermore, I am interested in the application of machine learning in astrophysics. Additionally, my
curiosity extends to the realms of exoplanets and astrobiology. I care deeply about science
advocacy and believe that it’s essential to share the wonder and importance of science with the broader
community. <br> 

I am highly skilled in <code>Linux</code> and <code>Git</code>, and I am fluent in <code>Python</code> programming, specializing in packages such as <code>Numpy</code>, <code>Scipy</code>, <code>Matplotlib</code>, <code>Pytorch</code>, <code>Pandas</code>, <code>RM-TOOLS</code>, and <code>Astropy</code>. I am skilled in data analysis, Bayesian analysis, time-series analysis, algorithm development, and scientific computing. I have contributed significantly to the open-source scientific <code>Python</code> package <code>RM-TOOLS</code>, resulting in a published scientific paper in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomy Society. I am additionally experienced in:  <code> C++</code>, <code>SQL</code>, <code>AWS</code>, <code>Kubernetes</code>, <code>Docker</code>, Cloud Computing, and Big Data.<br>


While I currently live in the Netherlands, I hold dual citizenship in the USA and Canada, which enables me to work & live in both countries.  As a UofT graduate, I additionally qualify for the High Potential Individual visa (UK work visa).
