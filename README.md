### About Me:

My name is Max Fine. I'm a graduate student studying Physics & Astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam. I am a member of the [Astro Flash](https://astroflash-frb.github.io/) research group at the University of Amsterdam, the [CHIME/FRB](https://www.chime-frb.ca/) collaboration, and [POSSUM](https://askap.org/possum/). This past summer, I worked at Astron - the Dutch Radio astronomy institute. I earned my undergraduate degree from the University of Toronto (with Honors)  in Canada! I am originally from St. Augustine, Florida. 

While I currently live in the Netherlands, I hold dual citizenship in the USA and Canada, which enables me to work & live in both countries.  As a UofT graduate, I additionally qualify for the High Potential Individual visa (UK work visa).  

When I'm not studying the stars, you can often find me exploring cafes and searching for the perfect latte. If it is not raining, playing frisbee in a park. I enjoy reading and tickering with Raspberry Pis.

My dream is to live the adventurous life of a scientific researcher. I would like to earn a PhD in radio astronomy related to FRBs, and serve in the Peace Corps teaching high school math and science for two years abroad.

### Research Interests:



I have a keen interest in Fast Radio Bursts, both in finding them, and using them to study the cosmos.  I have a broad interest in radio astronomy, technosignatures (SETI), astrophysical transients, pulsars, multi-messenger astronomy, observational cosmology, scintillation, radio polarization, cosmic magnetism, instrumentation. 

I am further interested in data science for radio & multimessenger astronomy - including algorithm, software development, and machine learning. I think finding exoplanets, and Gravitational Wave astronomy is neat. 

My research background includes Hunting Fast Radio Burst (FRB) using the [25m Dwingeloo Radio Telescope](https://www.astron.nl/), algorithm development for studying rotation measure (used to study magnetic fields in space), error testing a data
analysis pipeline for [Polarization Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM)](https://askap.org/possum/), and Hunting FRBs with multimessenger astronomy using the [Swift/Bat X-ray space telescope](https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/about_swift/bat_desc.html). <br> 

### Publications:
[**Maxwell A. Fine** , Cameron L. Van Eck, & Luke Pratley “Correcting Bandwidth Depolarization by Extreme Faraday Rotation”, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 2023.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03134)


### Technical Skills:
I am highly skilled in <code>Python</code>, <code>Bash</code>, and <code>Linux</code>, with extensive experience using packages such as <code>Astropy</code>, <code>Fetch</code>, <code>HEAsoft</code>, <code>Matplotlib</code>, <code>Numpy</code>, <code>Pandas</code>, <code>Presto</code>, <code>Pytorch</code>, <code>RM-TOOLS</code>, <code>Scikit-Learn</code>, <code>Scipy</code>, <code>TensorFlow</code>, and <code>Xspec</code>. I have expertise in Bayesian analysis, time-series analysis, algorithm development, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Fourier analysis, signal processing, machine learning, deep learning, big data (Tb Scale), <code>Git</code>, <code>Docker</code>, and scientific computing.

I have hands-on experience with <code>RaspberryPi</code> projects and moderate knowledge of <code>C++</code>, <code>Julia</code>, <code>SQL</code>, <code>Kubernetes</code>, cloud computing platforms such as <code>AWS</code>, and High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments. 

I have contributed significantly to the open-source scientific <code>Python</code> package <code>RM-TOOLS</code>, resulting in a published first author [scientific paper in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomy Society](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.520.4822F/abstract).
