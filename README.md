### 🔭 Projects & Research  
- 📡 **Scintillation of repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)** — My MSc thesis at the University of Amsterdam explores how FRBs twinkle, [(Private CHIME project repo, private)](https://github.com/CHIMEFRB/chime_repeaters_scintillation).  
- 🛰️ **Multiwavelength search for FRBs** — searched for with gamma-ray counter parts of FRBS using CHIME & Swift/BAT satellite. [Repo](https://github.com/afinemax/swift-bat)  
- 🧲 **Correcting extreme Faraday rotation** — Method for correcting intrachannel bandwidth depolarization, implemented into [RM-Tools(Repo)](https://github.com/CIRADA-Tools/RM-Tools). [MNRAS Fine et al 2023 (paper)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03134) 
- 🛠️ **DIY Radio Astronomy** — Building a functioning paint-can radio telescope. [Project Repo](https://github.com/afinemax/C.A.N.-Compact-Astronomy-Node)  
- 🌍 **Climate data bot** — Built a Mastodon bot to post daily Antarctic and North Atlantic sea ice data. [Repo](https://github.com/afinemax/climate_change_bot)  
- 📡 **FRBs with the 25m Dwingeloo Radio Telescope** — Built a real-time FRB dection pipeline for the 25M radio telescope, and detected a real burst during summer 2024 internship at ASTRON. [Project Repo](https://github.com/afinemax/Astron_2024)

### About Me:

My name is Max Fine. I'm a graduate student studying Physics & Astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam. I am a member of the [Astro Flash](https://astroflash-frb.github.io/) research group at the University of Amsterdam, the [CHIME/FRB](https://www.chime-frb.ca/) collaboration. When I'm not studying the stars, you can often find me exploring cafes and searching for the perfect latte. If it is not raining, playing frisbee in a park. I enjoy reading and tickering with Raspberry Pis.

### Research Interests:

I have a keen interest in Fast Radio Bursts, both in finding them, and using them to study the cosmos.  I have a broad interest in radio astronomy, astrophysical transients, pulsars, multi-messenger astronomy, observational cosmology, scintillation, radio polarization, cosmic magnetism, instrumentation. I am further interested in data science for radio & multimessenger astronomy - including algorithm, software development, and machine learning. I think finding exoplanets, and Gravitational Wave astronomy is neat.
