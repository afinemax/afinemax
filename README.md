# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

My name is Max Fine. I'm a graduate student studying Physics & Astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam. I earned my undergraduate degree from the University of Toronto (with Honors)  in Canada! I am originally from St. Augustine, Florida. I'm passionate about exploring the unknown, improving our understanding of the cosmos, and adding to the collective knowledge of humankind. I believe that science has the power to change the world and I'm eager to contribute to that change in any way I can.<br> 

I have a keen interest in radio astronomy, multimessenger astronomy, scientific data processing with a potential inclination towards instrumentation. Whether it's actively searching for celestial objects as an observational astronomer or delving into the intricacies of data processing. My background includes experience in algorithm development for radio astronomy, as well as dedicated research in Fast Radio Burst (FRB) and multimessenger astronomy. Furthermore, I am interested in the application of machine learning in astrophysics. Additionally, my curiosity extends to the fascinating realms of exoplanets and astrobiology. I care deeply about science advocacy and believe that it's essential to share the wonder and importance of science with the broader community.

I am highly skilled in Linux, Git, Github, Bash, C++ and fluent in Python programming, specializing in packages such as Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Pandas, RM-TOOLS, and Astropy. I am skilled in data analysis, time-series analysis, Bayesian analysis, algorithm development, and scientific computing. I have contributed significantly to the open-source scientific Python package RM-TOOLS, resulting in a published scientific paper. I am additionally experienced in:  SQL, AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, Cloud Computing, and Big Data.

While I currently live in the Netherlands, I hold dual citizenship in the USA and Canada, which enables me to work & live in both countries.  As a UofT graduate, I additionally qualify for the High Potential Individual visa (UK work visa).
