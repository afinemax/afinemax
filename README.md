My name is Max Fine. I'm a graduate student studying Physics & Astrophysics at the University of Amsterdam. I earned my undergraduate degree from the University of Toronto (with Honors)  in Canada! I am originally from St. Augustine, Florida. I'm passionate about exploring the unknown, improving our understanding of the cosmos, and adding to the collective knowledge of humankind. I believe that science has the power to change the world and I'm eager to contribute to that change in any way I can.<br> 

I have a keen interest in radio astronomy and multimessenger astronomy, with a focus on studying Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). I have a keen interested in studying Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) both in finding them, and using them to study the cosmos, IE FRBs and Cosmology. I am addtionally interested in scientific
data processing, software, and algorithim development. Furthermore, I am interested in the application of machine learning techniques in astronomy. My research background includes Hunting Fast Radio Burst (FRB) using the [25m Dwingeloo Radio Telescope](https://www.astron.nl/), algorithm development for radio polarization astronomy surveys, error testing a data
analysis pipeline, and Hunting FRBs with multimessenger astronomy using the [Swift/Bat space telescope](https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/about_swift/bat_desc.html). I care deeply about science
advocacy and believe that it’s essential to share the wonder and importance of science with the broader
community. <br> 

I am highly skilled in <code>Python</code>, <code>Linux</code> and <code>Git</code>, specializing in packages such as <code>Numpy</code>, <code>Scipy</code>, <code>Matplotlib</code>, <code>Pytorch</code>, <code>Pandas</code>, <code>Scikit-Learn</code>, <code>RM-TOOLS</code>, and <code>Astropy</code>. I am skilled in data analysis, Bayesian analysis, time-series analysis, algorithm development, Fourier analysis, signal processing, machine learning, deep learning, big data (Tb Scale), <code> Bash</code>, <code>Docker</code>, cloud computing, and scientific computing. I have contributed significantly to the open-source scientific <code>Python</code> package <code>RM-TOOLS</code>, resulting in a published first author [scientific paper in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomy Society](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.520.4822F/abstract). I am additionally experienced in:  <code> C++</code>, <code>SQL</code>, <code>AWS</code>, <code>Kubernetes</code>,<br>


While I currently live in the Netherlands, I hold dual citizenship in the USA and Canada, which enables me to work & live in both countries.  As a UofT graduate, I additionally qualify for the High Potential Individual visa (UK work visa).  

When I'm not studying the stars, you can often find me exploring cafes and searching for the perfect latte. If it is not raining, playing frisbee in a park. I enjoy reading and tickering with Raspberry Pis.

My dream is to live the adventurous life of a scientific researcher. I would like to earn a PhD in radio astronomy related to FRBs, and serve in the Peace Corps teaching high school math and science for two years abroad.
